# Formalizer for Obsidian

Formalizer is an innovative Obsidian.md plugin designed to elevate your writing to a new level of professionalism and sophistication. By harnessing the power of [GoblinTools](http://goblin.tools), Formalizer effortlessly transforms your casual or unstructured text into a polished and formalized version, suitable for academic, professional, or any serious writing context.

## Key Features

- **Instant Text Formalization:** Easily formalize any selected text or entire documents with just a click, directly within your Obsidian editor.
- **Flexible Formalization Options:** Choose from a variety of formalization styles such as Professional, Polite, Readable, and more, to match the tone and context of your writing.
- **Integration with GoblinTools:** Leverages the advanced linguistic capabilities of GoblinTools to ensure your text is formalized accurately and effectively.
- **Simple and Intuitive:** A user-friendly interface allows for seamless operation without disrupting your writing flow.

## **Note on Data Processing**
Please be aware that Formalizer sends your text to an external service, [GoblinTools](http://goblin.tools), for the formalization process. This step is essential for achieving the high-quality transformation of your text from informal to formal.

### Privacy and Security
We prioritize the privacy and security of your data:

**Data Handling**: Your text is securely transmitted to GoblinTools for processing and then returned to your Obsidian environment. No content is stored on external servers beyond the processing time.
**Minimal Data Transfer**: Only the text you select for formalization is sent to GoblinTools. The plugin serves as an interface to the functionality provided by `goblin.tools`, ensuring efficient and focused data use.
**Confidentiality**: To maintain your privacy, avoid including sensitive or personal information in the text processed through Formalizer. Data is transmitted to goblin.tools, and subsequently to OpenAI, so treat it as you would with any input into ChatGPT.

By using Formalizer, you acknowledge and consent to this data processing as part of the plugin's functionality. If you have any concerns or queries about this process, we encourage you to get in touch.
